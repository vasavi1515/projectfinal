Steps to run project

1.	Open project and navigate to individual folders using command prompt or terminal:
For example open order-delivery folder and cd into backend folder.
2.	Type npm install to have all packages installed. After installation is complete run npm run dev to run backend api.
3.	Navigate into frontend folder, npm install to have packages installed and then after installation npm run dev. 

You will follow the same for restaurant api and frontend.
